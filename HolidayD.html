<h1>Istanbul Turkey</h1>
<p>Istanbul is located in north-western Turkey and straddles the strait Bosporus,
 which provides the only passage from the Black Sea to the Mediterranean via the Sea of Marmara.
 Historically, the city has been ideally situated for trade and defense: The confluence of the Sea of Marmara,
 the Bosphorus, and the Golden Horn provide both ideal defense against enemy attack and a natural toll-gate.
 Several picturesque islands—Büyükada, Heybeliada, Burgazada, Kınalıada, and five smaller islands—are part of the city.
 Istanbul's shoreline has grown beyond its natural limits. Large sections of Caddebostan sit on areas of landfill, 
 increasing the total area of the city to 5,343 square kilometers (2,063 sq mi).
Despite the myth that seven hills make up the city, there are in fact more than 50 hills within the city limits.
 Istanbul's tallest hill, Aydos, is 537 metres (1,762 ft) high.</p>
